# ConvexHull

- TODO (implementation of an convex hull algorithm published by (link paper)

### TODOS
- Code is written very strangely (can't remeber why), go through code and fix/clean up
- Include visualizer and tester written in C#

## Convex hull

In mathematics, the convex hull or convex envelope of a set X of points in the Euclidean plane or
in a Euclidean space (or, more generally, in an affine space over the reals) is the smallest convex
set that contains X. For instance, when X is a bounded subset of the plane, the convex hull may be
visualized as the shape enclosed by a rubber band stretched around X.
