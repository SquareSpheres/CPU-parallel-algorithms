OpenMP implementation of different connected component algorithms. Baseline algortihm is a
sequenital DFS implementation with O(V + E) running time, and is found in the Boost Graph library.

## Connected Component 

In graph theory, a connected component (or just component) of an undirected graph is a subgraph in which any two vertices are connected to each other by paths, and which is connected to no additional vertices in the supergraph.
